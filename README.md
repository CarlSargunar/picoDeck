# picoDeck

A Crazy idea of Mine of using a Raspberry Pi Pico + a keyboard kit to make a basic streamdeck type utility. 

- Initially start with just macro keyboards which can be set-up with stream deck
- Hardware 
  - Pico : [https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
  - Keyboard : [https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-rgb-keypad-base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-rgb-keypad-base)
- Build to work with a basic main.py + a settings file


- Later versions can maybe do stuff with windows generally - eg 
  - Mute microphone (cough button)
  - Run windows explorer 
  - Open a terminal window
  - Any other ideas?
